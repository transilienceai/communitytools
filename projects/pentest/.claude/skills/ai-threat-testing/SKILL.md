# AI Threat Testing

Test LLM applications for OWASP LLM Top 10 vulnerabilities using 10 specialized agents. Use for authorized AI security assessments.

## Quick Start

```
1. Specify target (LLM app URL, API endpoint, or local model)
2. Select scope: Full OWASP Top 10 | Specific vulnerability | Supply chain
3. Agents deploy, test, capture evidence
4. Professional report with PoCs generated
```

## Primary Agents

Each agent targets one OWASP LLM vulnerability:

1. **Prompt Injection** (LLM01): Direct/indirect injection, system prompt extraction
2. **Output Handling** (LLM02): Code/XSS injection, unsafe deserialization
3. **Training Poisoning** (LLM03): Membership inference, backdoors, data extraction
4. **Resource Exhaustion** (LLM04): Token flooding, DoS, cost impact
5. **Supply Chain** (LLM05): Dependency scanning, plugin security
6. **Excessive Agency** (LLM06): Privilege escalation, unauthorized actions
7. **Model Extraction** (LLM07): Query-based theft, data reconstruction
8. **Vector Poisoning** (LLM08): RAG injection, retrieval manipulation
9. **Overreliance** (LLM09): Hallucination testing, confidence manipulation
10. **Logging Bypass** (LLM10): Monitoring evasion, forensic gaps

See `agents/llm0X-*.md` for agent details.

## Workflows

**Full Assessment** (4-8 hours):
```
- [ ] Reconnaissance
- [ ] Deploy all 10 agents
- [ ] Execute exploits
- [ ] Capture evidence
- [ ] Generate report
```

**Focused Testing** (1-3 hours):
```
- [ ] Select vulnerability (LLM01-10)
- [ ] Deploy agent
- [ ] Execute techniques
- [ ] Document findings
```

**Supply Chain Audit** (2-4 hours):
```
- [ ] Inventory dependencies
- [ ] Scan CVEs
- [ ] Test plugins/APIs
- [ ] Verify model provenance
```

## Integration

Enhances `/pentest` with AI-specific testing:
- Traditional pentesting + AI threat testing = complete security assessment
- Chain vulnerabilities across traditional and AI vectors
- Unified reporting with CVSS scores

## Key Techniques

**Prompt Injection**: Instruction override, system prompt extraction, filter evasion
**Model Extraction**: Query sampling, token analysis, membership inference
**Data Poisoning**: Behavioral anomalies, backdoor triggers, bias analysis
**DoS**: Token flooding, recursive expansion, context exhaustion
**Supply Chain**: CVE scanning, plugin audit, model verification

## Evidence Capture

All agents collect: screenshots, network logs, API responses, errors, console output, execution metrics.

## Reporting

Automated reports include: executive summary, detailed findings (CVSS scores), PoC scripts, evidence, remediation guidance.

## Critical Rules

- Written authorization REQUIRED before testing
- Never exceed defined scope
- Test in isolated environments when possible
- Document all findings with reproducible PoCs
- Follow responsible disclosure practices

## Integration

- Integrates with `/pentest` skill for comprehensive security testing
- AI-specific vulnerability knowledge in `/AGENTS.md`
- Agent definitions in `agents/llm0X-*.md`
