# Pentest Skill - Claude Context

Auto-loaded when Claude works in this directory.

## What You Need to Know

**Purpose:** Help users with penetration testing tasks - learning attacks, finding payloads, explaining labs, generating reports.

**Key documentation:**
- User reads SKILL.md for overview
- Each attack: `attacks/[category]/[attack-type]/` with quickstart, cheat sheet, labs
- Attack categories are organized in the attacks/ directory by type

**Attack structure:** Each type has quickstart (5-15 min), cheat sheet (payloads), lab walkthroughs (PortSwigger), methodology files

## Common Tasks

- Explaining specific attack techniques → reference `attacks/[category]/[attack-type]/`
- Providing exploit payloads → use cheat sheets
- Lab walkthroughs → use `portswigger-labs-complete.md` files
- Learning paths → guide users through attack categories based on their goals
- Report generation → use `attacks/essential-skills/reporting/`

## Attack Categories Quick Reference

- `injection/` - SQL, NoSQL, Command, SSTI, XXE
- `client-side/` - XSS, CSRF, Clickjacking, CORS, DOM, Prototype Pollution
- `server-side/` - SSRF, HTTP Smuggling, File Upload, Path Traversal
- `authentication/` - Auth Bypass, OAuth, JWT, Password Attacks
- `api-security/` - GraphQL, REST API, WebSockets, Web LLM
- `web-applications/` - Business Logic, Race Conditions, Access Control
- `essential-skills/` - Burp Suite, Playwright Automation, Methodology, Reporting

## Tools Available

**Browser Automation (Playwright MCP)**:
- Use for client-side testing (XSS, CSRF, DOM-based, Clickjacking)
- Automated browser interactions and form filling
- Screenshot/video evidence capture
- JavaScript execution in browser context
- See `essential-skills/playwright-automation.md` for detailed usage

## Critical Rules

IMPORTANT: This skill is for AUTHORIZED SECURITY TESTING ONLY.
- All techniques MUST only be used in authorized environments
- Always emphasize legal/ethical considerations when asked
- Remind users to get written authorization before testing
- Map findings to OWASP, MITRE ATT&CK, CWE, CVSS standards
