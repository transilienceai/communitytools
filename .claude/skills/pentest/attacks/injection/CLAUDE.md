# Injection Attacks

Injection vulnerabilities occur when untrusted data is sent to an interpreter as part of a command or query.

## Attack Types in This Category

- **sql-injection/** - SQL injection (all databases: MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, MSSQL)
- **nosql-injection/** - NoSQL injection (MongoDB, CouchDB, Cassandra, Redis)
- **command-injection/** - OS command injection
- **ssti/** - Server-Side Template Injection (Jinja2, ERB, Tornado, Django, etc.)
- **xxe/** - XML External Entity injection
- **ldap-xpath-injection/** - LDAP and XPath injection (if present)

## Quick Reference

**Easiest to exploit:** SQL Injection (basic), Command Injection
**Most common:** SQL Injection, Command Injection
**Highest impact:** Command Injection (RCE), SQL Injection (data breach)
**Most complex:** SSTI, XXE

## Testing Approach

1. Identify injection points (user inputs, parameters, headers)
2. Test with basic payloads from cheat sheets
3. Analyze error messages and responses
4. Exploit confirmed vulnerabilities with PoC
5. Document with CVSS scoring

IMPORTANT: Use these techniques only in authorized environments. Follow responsible disclosure practices.
