# Authentication Attacks

Vulnerabilities in authentication mechanisms, session management, and identity verification systems.

## Attack Types in This Category

- **auth-bypass/** - Authentication bypass techniques
- **oauth/** - OAuth and OAuth2 vulnerabilities
- **jwt/** - JSON Web Token attacks (signature bypass, algorithm confusion)
- **password-attacks/** - Password-based attacks (brute force, credential stuffing)

## Quick Reference

**Critical impact:** Authentication bypass (direct account takeover)
**Common flaws:** Weak session tokens, JWT algorithm confusion, OAuth misconfigurations
**High bounties:** OAuth account takeover chains, JWT 0-day bypasses
**Tool-friendly:** Password attacks (Burp Intruder, Hashcat)

## Testing Approach

1. **Basic auth:** Test for default credentials, weak passwords, username enumeration
2. **Session management:** Test token randomness, session fixation, logout issues
3. **JWT:** Test algorithm confusion (none, HS256→RS256), weak secrets, claim manipulation
4. **OAuth:** Test redirect_uri bypass, state parameter CSRF, code/token leakage
5. **Password reset:** Test for token predictability, email manipulation, race conditions
6. **MFA:** Test for MFA bypass, backup codes, SMS interception

IMPORTANT: Authentication attacks can lock out real users. Test carefully with test accounts in authorized environments.
