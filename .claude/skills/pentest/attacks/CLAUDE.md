# Pentest Attack Documentation

This directory contains detailed attack pattern documentation organized by category.

## Structure

Each attack type follows a standard documentation format:
- **quickstart.md** - Rapid exploitation guide (5-15 min)
- **cheat-sheet.md** - Payload and command reference
- **portswigger-labs-complete.md** - Step-by-step lab solutions
- **methodology/definition/exploitation files** - Detailed technical documentation
- **resources.md** - Tools, links, training materials

## Categories

- `injection/` - Injection attacks (SQL, NoSQL, Command, SSTI, XXE, LDAP)
- `client-side/` - Browser-based attacks (XSS, CSRF, Clickjacking, CORS)
- `server-side/` - Server infrastructure attacks (SSRF, HTTP Smuggling, File Upload)
- `authentication/` - Identity and access control (Auth Bypass, OAuth, JWT)
- `api-security/` - API-specific vulnerabilities (GraphQL, REST, WebSockets)
- `web-applications/` - Application logic flaws (Business Logic, Race Conditions)
- `network/` - Network-level attacks (Scanning, Sniffing, MITM)
- `system/` - System exploitation (Privilege Escalation, Active Directory)
- `cloud-containers/` - Cloud and container security (AWS, Azure, GCP, K8s)
- `essential-skills/` - Core pentesting skills (Burp Suite, Methodology)

## Usage

When working with attack documentation:
1. Start with the quickstart guide for rapid learning
2. Reference cheat sheets for specific payloads
3. Follow lab walkthroughs for hands-on practice
4. Use methodology files for structured testing

IMPORTANT: All techniques are for authorized testing only. Never test systems without written permission.
