# Server-Side Attacks

Server-side vulnerabilities exploit weaknesses in server logic, request handling, and backend processing.

## Attack Types in This Category

- **ssrf/** - Server-Side Request Forgery
- **http-smuggling/** - HTTP Request Smuggling
- **file-upload/** - Insecure file upload
- **path-traversal/** - Path traversal / directory disclosure
- **deserialization/** - Insecure deserialization
- **host-header/** - Host header injection

## Quick Reference

**Highest impact:** SSRF (cloud metadata access), Deserialization (RCE)
**Most complex:** HTTP Smuggling, Deserialization
**Common in cloud:** SSRF (AWS/Azure/GCP metadata)
**Critical CVEs:** Path Traversal (many recent CVSS 9.8+)

## Testing Approach

1. Test for SSRF with internal IPs and cloud metadata endpoints
2. Attempt path traversal with `../` sequences
3. Upload files with dangerous extensions (.php, .jsp, .aspx)
4. Test deserialization with ysoserial/PHPGGC payloads
5. Manipulate Host headers for cache poisoning
6. Test HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 smuggling techniques

IMPORTANT: Server-side attacks can cause service disruption. Test carefully in authorized environments only.
