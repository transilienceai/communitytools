# Client-Side Attacks

Client-side vulnerabilities exploit weaknesses in browser-based security mechanisms and user interactions.

## Attack Types in This Category

- **xss/** - Cross-Site Scripting (Reflected, Stored, DOM-based)
- **csrf/** - Cross-Site Request Forgery
- **clickjacking/** - UI redressing attacks
- **cors/** - Cross-Origin Resource Sharing misconfigurations
- **dom-based/** - DOM-based vulnerabilities
- **prototype-pollution/** - JavaScript prototype pollution

## Quick Reference

**Most common:** XSS (Reflected), CSRF
**Highest bounties:** Prototype Pollution ($10k-$50k), XSS chains
**Easiest to find:** Reflected XSS, Clickjacking
**Most impactful:** XSS → Account Takeover chains

## Testing Approach

1. Identify user input reflection points
2. Test basic XSS payloads in all contexts
3. Check CSRF tokens and SameSite cookies
4. Analyze JavaScript for DOM-based issues
5. Test prototype pollution in Node.js apps
6. Chain vulnerabilities for maximum impact

IMPORTANT: Only test in authorized environments. Client-side attacks can affect real users if tested on live systems without permission.
