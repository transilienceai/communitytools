# Pentest Skill Migration Guide: Burp Suite → Playwright

**Date**: 2026-01-20
**Version**: 2.0
**Breaking Change**: Yes

## Summary

The pentest skill has been refactored to use **Playwright MCP Server** as the primary testing tool, replacing Burp Suite. This provides modern browser automation, better SPA support, and easier evidence collection.

## What Changed

### Tool Priorities

**Before**:
- Primary: Burp Suite Professional
- Secondary: Playwright MCP (for specific cases)

**After**:
- Primary: Playwright MCP Server (browser automation)
- HTTP Testing: curl, Python requests, httpx (server-side)
- Specialized: sqlmap, nmap, metasploit, etc.

### Key Modifications

**1. SKILL.md**
- Playwright promoted to primary tool
- Burp Suite removed from tool list
- Attack categories updated with "(Playwright-based)" annotations
- Quick start guide reordered: Playwright fundamentals first
- Usage section updated to emphasize Playwright walkthroughs

**2. playwright-automation.md**
- Added "PRIMARY TOOL" designation
- Created comprehensive step-by-step experimentation methodology
- Added detailed XSS testing walkthrough (9 steps)
- Added detailed CSRF testing walkthrough (8 steps)
- Emphasized use during Flaw Hypothesis Methodology experimentation phase

**3. CLAUDE.md**
- Updated tools section to prioritize Playwright
- Added reminder to follow step-by-step walkthroughs
- Clarified when to use HTTP testing vs browser automation

## Why This Change?

### Benefits of Playwright

**1. Modern Web Application Support**
- Native JavaScript execution
- Full SPA/React/Vue/Angular support
- WebSocket and real-time feature testing
- DOM-based vulnerability detection

**2. Easier for Beginners**
- No proxy configuration required
- Direct browser interaction
- Visual feedback (screenshots/videos)
- Simpler learning curve

**3. Better Evidence Collection**
- Built-in screenshot capture
- Video recording capabilities
- Network traffic monitoring
- Console log capture

**4. Step-by-Step Experimentation**
- Systematic hypothesis testing
- Documented experimentation workflow
- Evidence-based validation
- Learning through experimentation

### Limitations Addressed

**Server-Side Testing**: Use curl, Python requests, or httpx for:
- SQL injection
- Command injection
- SSRF (when not browser-based)
- File upload vulnerabilities
- Path traversal

## Migration Guide

### For Existing Users

**If you used Burp Suite for client-side testing**:
- ✅ Switch to Playwright MCP walkthroughs
- ✅ Follow step-by-step experimentation methodology
- ✅ Capture evidence with playwright_screenshot

**If you used Burp Suite for server-side testing**:
- ✅ Use curl or Python requests instead
- ✅ Refer to attack-specific documentation
- ✅ Maintain same testing methodology

**If you used Burp Suite Scanner**:
- ✅ Manual testing with Playwright walkthroughs
- ✅ Hypothesis-driven testing approach
- ✅ More thorough, less automated

### New Workflow Example

**Old Workflow (Burp Suite)**:
1. Configure Burp proxy
2. Browse application through proxy
3. Send request to Repeater
4. Modify and test payloads
5. Screenshot from browser
6. Document findings

**New Workflow (Playwright)**:
1. Launch Playwright session
2. Navigate with playwright_navigate
3. Use playwright_snapshot to find elements
4. Test with playwright_fill/playwright_type
5. Validate with playwright_evaluate
6. Capture with playwright_screenshot
7. Document with complete evidence trail

## Step-by-Step Experimentation

### Key Addition: Structured Walkthroughs

The skill now includes detailed step-by-step Playwright walkthroughs for experimentation:

**9-Step XSS Walkthrough**:
1. Navigate to search page
2. Capture page structure
3. Test benign input (control)
4. Test simple XSS payload
5. Check for script execution
6. Try alternative payload
7. Verify exploitation
8. Test impact
9. Document findings

**8-Step CSRF Walkthrough**:
1. Login with test account
2. Navigate to password change
3. Inspect form for CSRF protection
4. Capture legitimate request
5. Test CSRF exploitation
6. Execute attack simulation
7. Verify password changed
8. Document impact

### When to Use Walkthroughs

**CRITICAL**: Use step-by-step Playwright walkthroughs during:
- **Experimentation Phase** (Flaw Hypothesis Methodology Step 3)
- **Hypothesis Validation** (testing if vulnerability exists)
- **Impact Assessment** (determining severity)
- **PoC Development** (before writing automated scripts)

## Integration with Existing Skills

### Compatible Skills
- ✅ `common-appsec-patterns` - Uses Playwright for XSS, CSRF, etc.
- ✅ `web-application-mapping` - Browser automation for discovery
- ✅ `cve-testing` - Can use Playwright for browser-based CVEs
- ✅ `domain-assessment` - Complementary reconnaissance

### Methodology Unchanged
- PTES 7-phase lifecycle: No changes
- OWASP WSTG testing categories: No changes
- MITRE ATT&CK mapping: No changes
- Flaw Hypothesis Methodology: **Enhanced** with Playwright walkthroughs

## Tools Reference

### Playwright MCP Tools Used

**Navigation**:
- `playwright_navigate(url)` - Navigate to page
- `playwright_navigate_back()` - Go back

**Interaction**:
- `playwright_click(element, ref)` - Click elements
- `playwright_fill(selector, value)` - Fill single field
- `playwright_fill_form(fields)` - Fill multiple fields
- `playwright_type(element, ref, text)` - Type text

**Observation**:
- `playwright_snapshot()` - Capture page structure
- `playwright_evaluate(function)` - Execute JavaScript
- `playwright_console_messages()` - Check console logs
- `playwright_network_requests()` - Monitor traffic

**Evidence**:
- `playwright_screenshot(filename)` - Capture screenshots
- `playwright_wait(time)` - Wait for processing

### HTTP Testing Tools

**For server-side vulnerabilities**:
```bash
# SQL Injection testing
curl -X POST https://target.com/api/search \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query": "' UNION SELECT password FROM users--"}'

# Command Injection testing
curl https://target.com/ping?host=127.0.0.1;id

# SSRF testing
curl -X POST https://target.com/webhook \
  -d "url=http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/"
```

## FAQ

**Q: Can I still use Burp Suite?**
A: Yes, but it's no longer covered in this skill. Use Playwright for primary testing.

**Q: What about Burp Scanner?**
A: The skill now emphasizes manual testing with Playwright walkthroughs for deeper understanding.

**Q: Is Playwright slower than Burp?**
A: Slightly, but provides better evidence and learning experience.

**Q: Can Playwright test APIs?**
A: Yes, via browser (fetch/XHR), but use curl/httpx for direct API testing.

**Q: What about Burp extensions?**
A: Most functionality can be replicated with Playwright JavaScript execution.

**Q: How do I test server-side vulnerabilities?**
A: Use curl, Python requests, or httpx - server-side testing unchanged.

## Support

**Issues**: Create GitHub issue in communitytools repo
**Questions**: Reference `essential-skills/playwright-automation.md`
**Learning**: Start with XSS and CSRF walkthroughs in documentation
