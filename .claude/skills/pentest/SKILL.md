# Penetration Testing Knowledge Base

Security testing knowledge: vulnerability types, attack techniques, testing methodologies, and output standards.

**IMPORTANT**: General payloads/methodologies in `/AGENTS.md`. This skill has detailed attack documentation. Execution orchestration via `pentester` agent.

## When to Use

**Use this skill for:** Vulnerability types, attack techniques, methodologies, PortSwigger labs, output standards

**Use pentester agent for:** Multi-phase orchestration, agent deployment, tool coordination

## Vulnerability Index (46+ types)

Injection (6) | Client-Side (6) | Server-Side (6) | Authentication (4) | API (4) | Web Apps (6) | Network (4) | System (4) | Cloud (6) | Skills (3)

See `attacks/` for detailed documentation on each type.

## Attack Documentation Structure

Progressive disclosure: Level 1 (quickstart, cheat-sheet) → Level 2 (PortSwigger labs) → Level 3 (definition, methodology, exploitation, resources)

## Primary Methodologies

PTES (7-phase) | OWASP WSTG (12 categories) | MITRE ATT&CK (TTP mapping) | Flaw Hypothesis (experimentation)

See `attacks/essential-skills/methodology/` for complete frameworks.

## Playwright Automation (PRIMARY TOOL)

See `attacks/essential-skills/playwright-automation.md` for client-side testing automation.

## Output Structure

### Intermediary Outputs (Per Phase)

**Phase 1:** Authorization checklist (`outputs/{engagement}/phase-1-auth.md`)

**Phase 2:** Reconnaissance inventory
- `outputs/{engagement}/inventory/` (assets.json, technologies.json, attack-surface.md)
- Testing checklist for Phase 3

**Phase 3:** Vulnerability findings
- `outputs/{engagement}/findings/finding-NNN/` (per finding)
  - poc.py, poc_output.txt, workflow.md, description.md, evidence/

**Phase 4-5:** Post-exploitation results (if applicable)
- Internal reconnaissance, privilege escalation paths, detection assessment

**Complete templates:** `reference/intermediate-reports/PHASE_REPORTING.md`

### Final Outputs (End of Engagement)

**Three deliverables:**

1. **Executive Summary** (`reports/executive-summary.md`)
   - 1-2 pages, business focus
   - Top 3-5 findings, business impact, remediation timeline

2. **Technical Report** (`reports/technical-report.md`)
   - Comprehensive findings, PoCs, remediation
   - Maps to OWASP, CWE, CVSS v3.1, MITRE ATT&CK

3. **JSON Export** (`findings/findings.json`)
   - Machine-readable for SIEM/vulnerability management

**Complete templates:** `attacks/essential-skills/reporting/PROFESSIONAL_REPORT_STANDARD.md`

## Advanced Techniques

Novel techniques: XXE file write | Privilege escalation patterns | Information disclosure discovery

See attack-specific files for implementation details.


## Quick Navigation

XSS | SQL injection | Methodology | Reporting | Playwright | Output Standards

See sections above for specific paths.

## Learning Paths

Beginners → Intermediate → Advanced; Bug bounty specialization; BSCP certification tracks available

## Integration

Works with: `/ai-threat-testing` | `/authenticating` | `/hackerone` | Pentester agent

## Critical Rules

**AUTHORIZED TESTING ONLY:** Written authorization, never exceed scope, authorized targets only

**Quality Standards:** OWASP/MITRE/CWE/CVSS mapping, working PoCs, Playwright evidence, follow output standards
