# Penetration Testing Skill

Comprehensive penetration testing knowledge base with 46+ attack types, 264+ lab walkthroughs, and industry-standard methodologies.

## Navigation

- **[INDEX.md](./INDEX.md)** - Complete master index with learning paths and detailed documentation
- **attacks/** - All attack documentation organized by category

## When to Use

- Authorized security assessments and penetration tests
- Vulnerability assessments (web apps, networks, systems)
- Bug bounty hunting and security research
- BSCP/OSCP/OSWE certification prep
- CTF competitions and challenges
- Professional security testing engagements

## Methodology

IMPORTANT: This skill uses a **polymethodology** combining industry frameworks:
- **PTES** - 7-phase lifecycle (pre-engagement → reporting)
- **OWASP WSTG** - 11 technical testing categories
- **MITRE ATT&CK** - Real-world adversary TTPs
- **FHM** - Scientific hypothesis-driven testing

### Multi-Agent Parallel Testing

Deploy specialized agents in parallel for 6x faster testing:
- Injection agents (SQL, NoSQL, Command, SSTI, XXE)
- Client-side agents (XSS, CSRF, Clickjacking, CORS, DOM)
- Server-side agents (SSRF, HTTP Smuggling, File Upload)
- Authentication agents (Auth Bypass, OAuth, JWT)
- API security agents (GraphQL, REST, WebSockets)
- Business logic agents (Logic Flaws, Race Conditions)

### 7-Phase Testing Lifecycle

1. **Pre-Engagement** - Written authorization, scope, RoE
2. **Intelligence Gathering** - Passive/active recon, attack surface mapping
3. **Threat Modeling** - Prioritize targets, identify TTPs, create attack trees
4. **Vulnerability Analysis** - Automated scanning + manual OWASP WSTG testing
5. **Exploitation** - PoC exploits, test exploit chains, validate impact
6. **Post-Exploitation** - Privilege escalation, lateral movement, persistence
7. **Reporting** - Executive summary + technical findings with CVSS scores

### Flaw Hypothesis Methodology

Apply scientific method to pentesting:
1. **Information Gathering** - Collect tech stack and architecture details
2. **Hypothesis Generation** - Predict vulnerabilities based on technologies
3. **Experimentation** - Test hypotheses with PoC exploits
4. **Generalization** - Test similar flaws in related components
5. **Analysis** - Correlate findings, identify exploit chains
6. **Reporting** - Document hypotheses, experiments, and results

## Quick Start by Use Case

**Beginners:**
1. `essential-skills/burp-suite/` - Master the fundamentals
2. `injection/sql-injection/` - First vulnerability (18 labs)
3. `client-side/xss/` - Learn XSS (33 labs)

**Bug Bounty Hunters:**
- High volume: `client-side/xss/`, `web-applications/access-control/`
- High severity: `injection/sql-injection/`, `server-side/ssrf/`, `authentication/auth-bypass/`
- Cutting edge: `authentication/oauth/`, `api-security/graphql/`, `client-side/prototype-pollution/`

**BSCP Certification:** See INDEX.md "Learning Path 1" (60-80 hours)

**Professional Pentesters:** See INDEX.md "Learning Path 3" (80-120 hours)

## Documentation Structure

Each attack type includes:
- **Quickstart** - Rapid exploitation guide
- **Cheat sheet** - Payload/command reference
- **Lab walkthroughs** - Step-by-step PortSwigger solutions
- **Methodology** - Structured testing approach
- **Resources** - Tools and references

## Tools

**Primary:** Burp Suite Professional (see `essential-skills/burp-suite/`)

**Specialized:** sqlmap, XSS Hunter, Burp Collaborator, tplmap, ysoserial, nmap, Metasploit, Hashcat, awscli, kubectl

## Standards & Mappings

All documentation maps to OWASP Top 10, MITRE ATT&CK, CWE, CAPEC, and CVSS v3.1.

## Coverage

46+ attack types | 264+ labs | 200+ CVE examples | Complete BSCP/OSCP/OSWE prep

## Legal & Ethical

IMPORTANT: Only test authorized systems:
- ✅ PortSwigger Academy labs, HackTheBox, TryHackMe, bug bounty programs (in-scope), contracted pentests with RoE
- ❌ Never test without written authorization, exceed scope, cause damage, or skip responsible disclosure

## Output Structure

**Format**: Vulnerability Testing (Findings + Evidence)

See `/.claude/OUTPUT_STANDARDS.md` for complete specification.

**When performing actual testing** (not just learning):
- Generate findings.json with all vulnerabilities
- Capture evidence (screenshots, HTTP, videos)
- Create executive and technical reports
- Use standard CVSS, CWE, OWASP mappings

## Using This Skill

1. Review scope and authorization
2. Set up tools (`essential-skills/burp-suite/`)
3. Follow methodology (`essential-skills/methodology/`)
4. Reference [INDEX.md](./INDEX.md) for attack categories
5. Use quickstart guides and cheat sheets
6. Document findings per OUTPUT_STANDARDS.md
